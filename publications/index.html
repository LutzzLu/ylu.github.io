      <p>Background: Spatial transcriptomics involves studying the spatial organization of gene expression within tissues, offering insights into the molecular diversity of tumors. While spatial gene expression is commonly amalgamated from 1-10 cells across 50-micron spots, recent methods have demonstrated the capability to disaggregate this information at subspot resolution by leveraging both expression and histological patterns. However, elucidating such information from histology alone presents a significant challenge but if solved can better permit spatial molecular analysis at cellular resolution for instances where Visium data is not available, reducing study costs. This study explores integrating single-cell histological and transcriptomic data to infer spatial mRNA expression patterns in whole slide images collected from a cohort of stage pT3 colorectal cancer patients. A cell graph neural network algorithm was developed to align histological information extracted from detected cells with single cell RNA patterns through optimal transport methods, facilitating the analysis of cellular groupings and gene relationships. This approach leveraged spot-level expression as an intermediary to co-map histological and transcriptomic information at the single-cell level. Results: Our study demonstrated that single-cell transcriptional heterogeneity within a spot could be predicted from histological markers extracted from cells detected within a spot. Furthermore, our model exhibited proficiency in delineating overarching gene expression patterns across whole-slide images. This approach compared favorably to traditional patch-based computer vision methods as well as other methods which did not incorporate single cell expression during the model fitting procedures. Topological nuances of single-cell expression within a Visium spot were preserved using the developed methodology. Conclusion: This innovative approach augments the resolution of spatial molecular assays utilizing histology as a sole input through synergistic co-mapping of histological and transcriptomic datasets at the single-cell level, anchored by spatial transcriptomics. While initial results are promising, they warrant rigorous validation. This includes collaborating with pathologists for precise spatial identification of distinct cell types and utilizing sophisticated assays, such as Xenium, to attain deeper subcellular insights.</p>

      <p>Deep learning (DL) algorithms continue to develop at a rapid pace, providing researchers access to a set of tools capable of solving a wide array of biomedical challenges. While this progress is promising, it also leads to confusion regarding task-specific model choices, where deeper investigation is necessary to determine the optimal model configuration. Natural language processing (NLP) has the unique ability to accurately and efficiently capture a patient’s narrative, which can improve the operational efficiency of modern pathology laboratories through advanced computational solutions that can facilitate rapid access to and reporting of histological and molecular findings. In this study, we use pathology reports from a large academic medical system to assess the generalizability and potential real-world applicability of various deep learning-based NLP models on reports with highly specialized vocabulary and complex reporting structures. The performance of each NLP model examined was compared across four distinct tasks: 1) current procedural terminology (CPT) code classification, 2) pathologist classification, 3) report sign-out time regression, and 4) report text generation, under the hypothesis that models initialized on domain-relevant medical text would perform better than models not attuned to this prior knowledge. Our study highlights that the performance of deep learning-based NLP models can vary meaningfully across pathology-related tasks. Models pretrained on medical data outperform other models where medical domain knowledge is crucial, e.g., current procedural terminology (CPT) code classification. However, where interpretation is more subjective (i.e., teasing apart pathologist-specific lexicon and variable sign-out times), models with medical pretraining do not consistently outperform the other approaches. Instead, fine-tuning models pretrained on general or unrelated text sources achieved comparable or better results. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of considering the nature of the task at hand when selecting a pretraining strategy for NLP models in pathology. The optimal approach may vary depending on the specific requirements and nuances of the task, and related text sources can offer valuable insights and improve performance in certain cases, contradicting established notions about domain adaptation. This research contributes to our understanding of pretraining strategies for large language models and further informs the development and deployment of these models in pathology-related applications.</p>

      <p>The application of deep learning methods to spatial transcriptomics has shown promise in unraveling the complex relationships between gene expression patterns and tissue architecture as they pertain to various pathological conditions. Deep learning methods that can infer gene expression patterns directly from tissue histomorphology can expand the capability to discern spatial molecular markers within tissue slides. However, current methods utilizing these techniques are plagued by substantial variability in tissue preparation and characteristics, which can hinder the broader adoption of these tools. Furthermore, training deep learning models using spatial transcriptomics on small study cohorts remains a costly endeavor. Necessitating novel tissue preparation processes enhance assay reliability, resolution, and scalability. This study investigated the impact of an enhanced specimen processing workflow for facilitating a deep learning-based spatial transcriptomics assessment. The enhanced workflow leveraged the flexibility of the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated H&amp;E staining (e.g., Leica Bond) of tissue slides, whole-slide imaging at 40x-resolution, and multiplexing of tissue sections from multiple patients within individual capture areas for spatial transcriptomics profiling. Using a cohort of thirteen pT3 stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we compared the efficacy of deep learning models trained on slide prepared using an enhanced workflow as compared to the traditional workflow which leverages manual tissue staining and standard imaging of tissue slides. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we aimed to predict gene expression patterns across matched serial tissue sections, each stemming from a distinct workflow but aligned based on persistent histological structures. Findings indicate that the enhanced workflow considerably outperformed the traditional spatial transcriptomics workflow. Gene expression profiles predicted from enhanced tissue slides also yielded expression patterns more topologically consistent with the ground truth. This led to enhanced statistical precision in pinpointing biomarkers associated with distinct spatial structures. These insights can potentially elevate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker detection by broadening the range of spatial molecular markers linked to metastasis and recurrence. Future endeavors will further explore these findings to enrich our comprehension of various diseases and uncover molecular pathways with greater nuance. Combining deep learning with spatial transcriptomics provides a compelling avenue to enrich our understanding of tumor biology and improve clinical outcomes. For results of the highest fidelity, however, effective specimen processing is crucial, and fostering collaboration between histotechnicians, pathologists, and genomics specialists is essential to herald this new era in spatial transcriptomics-driven cancer research.</p>

      <p>Pathology reports contain vital information, yet a significant portion of this data remains underutilized in electronic medical record systems due to the unstructured and varied nature of reporting. Although synoptic reporting has introduced reporting standards, the majority of pathology text remains free-form, necessitating additional processing to enable accessibility for research and clinical applications. This paper presents Dendrite, a web application designed to enhance pathology research by providing intelligent search capabilities and streamlining the creation of study cohorts. Leveraging expert knowledge and natural language processing algorithms, Dendrite converts free-form pathology reports into structured formats, facilitating easier querying and analysis. Using a custom Python script, Dendrite organizes pathology report data, enabling record linkages, text searches, and structured drop-down menus for information filtering and integration. A companion web application enables data exploration and export, showcasing its potential for further analysis and research. Dendrite, derived from existing laboratory information systems, outperforms existing implementations in terms of speed, responsiveness, and flexibility. With its efficient search functionality and support for clinical research and quality improvement efforts in the pathology field, Dendrite proves to be a valuable tool for pathologists. Future enhancements encompass user management integration, integration of natural language processing and machine learning to enhance structured reporting capabilities and seamless integration of Dendrite with the vast repository of genomics and imaging data.</p>

      <p>Human cancers are heterogenous by their cell composition and origination site. Cancer metastasis generates the conundrum of the unknown origin of migrated tumor cells. Tracing tissue of origin and tumor type in primary and metastasized cancer is vital for clinical significance. DNA methylation alterations play a crucial role in carcinogenesis and mark cell fate differentiation, thus can be used to trace tumor tissue of origin. In this study, we employed a novel tumor-type-specific hierarchical model using genome-scale DNA methylation data to develop a multilayer perceptron model, HiTAIC, to trace tissue of origin and tumor type in 27 cancers from 23 tissue sites in data from 7735 tumors with high resolution, accuracy, and specificity. In tracing primary cancer origin, HiTAIC accuracy was 99% in the test set and 93% in the external validation data set. Metastatic cancers were identified with a 96% accuracy in the external data set. HiTAIC is a user-friendly web-based application through https://sites.dartmouth.edu/salaslabhitaic/. In conclusion, we developed HiTAIC, a DNA methylation-based algorithm, to trace tumor tissue of origin in primary and metastasized cancers. The high accuracy and resolution of tumor tracing using HiTAIC holds promise for clinical assistance in identifying cancer of unknown origin.</p>

      <p>Current Procedural Terminology Codes is a numerical coding system used to bill for medical procedures and services and crucially, represents a major reimbursement pathway. Given that pathology services represent a consequential source of hospital revenue, understanding instances where codes may have been misassigned or underbilled is critical. Several algorithms have been proposed that can identify improperly billed CPT codes in existing datasets of pathology reports. Estimation of the fiscal impacts of these reports requires a coder (i.e., billing staff) to review the original reports and manually code them again. As the re-assignment of codes using machine learning algorithms can be done quickly, the bottleneck in validating these reassignments is in this manual re-coding process, which can prove cumbersome. This work documents the development of a rapidly deployable dashboard for examination of reports that the original coder may have misbilled. Our dashboard features the following main components: (1) a bar plot to show the predicted probabilities for each CPT code, (2) an interpretation plot showing how each word in the report combines to form the overall prediction, and (3) a place for the user to input the CPT code they have chosen to assign. This dashboard utilizes the algorithms developed to accurately identify CPT codes to highlight the codes missed by the original coders. In order to demonstrate the function of this web application, we recruited pathologists to utilize it to highlight reports that had codes incorrectly assigned. We expect this application to accelerate the validation of re-assigned codes through facilitating rapid review of false-positive pathology reports. In the future, we will use this technology to review thousands of past cases in order to estimate the impact of underbilling has on departmental revenue.</p>

      <p>Graph-based deep learning has shown great promise in cancer histopathology image analysis by contextualizing complex morphology and structure across whole slide images to make high quality downstream outcome predictions (ex prognostication). These methods rely on informative representations (i.e., embeddings) of image patches comprising larger slides, which are used as node attributes in slide graphs. Spatial omics data, including spatial transcriptomics, is a novel paradigm offering a wealth of detailed information. Pairing this data with corresponding histological imaging localized at 50-micron resolution, may facilitate the development of algorithms which better appreciate the morphological and molecular underpinnings of carcinogenesis. Here, we explore the utility of leveraging spatial transcriptomics data with a contrastive crossmodal pretraining mechanism to generate deep learning models that can extract molecular and histological information for graph-based learning tasks. Performance on cancer staging, lymph node metastasis prediction, survival prediction, and tissue clustering analyses indicate that the proposed methods bring improvement to graph based deep learning models for histopathological slides compared to leveraging histological information from existing schemes, demonstrating the promise of mining spatial omics data to enhance deep learning for pathology workflows.</p>

      <p>The advent of spatial transcriptomics technologies has heralded a renaissance in research to advance our understanding of the spatial cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity within tissues. Spatial transcriptomics allows investigation of the interplay between cells, molecular pathways and the surrounding tissue architecture and can help elucidate developmental trajectories, disease pathogenesis, and various niches in the tumor microenvironment. Photoaging is the histological and molecular skin damage resulting from chronic/acute sun exposure and is a major risk factor for skin cancer. Spatial transcriptomics technologies hold promise for improving the reliability of evaluating photoaging and developing new therapeutics. Current challenges, including limited focus on dermal elastosis variations and reliance on self-reported measures, can introduce subjectivity and inconsistency. Spatial transcriptomics offer an opportunity to assess photoaging objectively and reproducibly in studies of carcinogenesis and discern the effectiveness of therapies that intervene on photoaging and prevent cancer. Evaluation of distinct histological architectures using highly-multiplexed spatial technologies can identify specific cell lineages that have been understudied due to their location beyond the depth of UV penetration. However, the cost and inter-patient variability using state-of-the-art assays such as the 10x Genomics Spatial Transcriptomics assays limits the scope and scale of large-scale molecular epidemiologic studies. Here, we investigate the inference of spatial transcriptomics information from routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&amp;E) tissue slides. We employed the Visium CytAssist spatial transcriptomics assay to analyze over 18,000 genes at a 50-micron resolution for four patients from a cohort of 261 skin specimens collected adjacent to surgical resection sites for basal and squamous keratinocyte tumors. The spatial transcriptomics data was co-registered with 40x resolution whole slide imaging (WSI) information. We developed machine learning models that achieved a macro-averaged median AUC and F1 score of 0.80 and 0.61 and Spearman coefficient of 0.60 in inferring transcriptomic profiles across the slides, and accurately captured biological pathways across various tissue architectures.</p>

      <p>Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) aims to excise cutaneous cancer with real-time margin analysis. However, manual tissue grossing and analysis can be inefficient, so we propose DeltaAI, a novel workflow that utilizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to enable rapid tissue grossing and generate a 3D model in an augmented reality (AR) environment. In our study, we captured 30-second videos of 17 MMS specimens using a photogrammetry turntable and cellphone camera. Preprocessing the tissues with segmentation models, we created a dataset of 923, 360-degree-view, images per video (17 videos). Using COLMAP, we estimated poses for sparse tissue reconstructions and trained the NeRF model for 3D volumetric tissue renderings. The results demonstrated that DeltaAI generated more accurate and complete 360-degree, 3D tissue renderings compared to previous models, while also achieving significantly faster runtimes. Our proposed semi-autonomous NeRF-based workflow has the potential to enhance the speed of MMS specimen processing, measurement, report generation, and margin assessment. It can inform real-time grossing decisions, automate the export of electronic health record data, and facilitate time-efficient and complete cancer excisions. Moreover, DeltaAI can contribute to the wider adoption of AI technology in clinical settings by improving tissue modeling for manual grossing.</p>
